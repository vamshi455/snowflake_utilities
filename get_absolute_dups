-- Step 1: Generate the list of column names for the table
SELECT LISTAGG(COLUMN_NAME, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION) AS column_list
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'YOUR_SCHEMA'
AND TABLE_NAME = 'YOUR_TABLE_NAME';

-- Step 2: Use the generated column list to construct the SQL query
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY {{column_list}}) AS duplicate_count
    FROM YOUR_TABLE_NAME
) AS subquery
WHERE duplicate_count > 1;
